      "introduction": "Taipei Main Station is not only the most significant hub of transportation in northern Taiwan, but also the largest railway station in terms of the building scale and traffic volume. Situated in Zhongzheng District of Taipei City, it is an underground union station shared by three transportation service companies: Taiwan Railway Administration, Taiwan High Speed Rail and Taipei Metro. Thus, a passenger can get access to a train, a high-speed rail, MRT Bannan Line and MRT Tamsui&ndash;Xinyi Line at the station.\r\n\r\nTaipei Main Station has been relocated and renovated numerous times since its establishment on July 5, 1891. The station building today was completed on September 2, 1989. It is also where the headquarters of Taiwan Railway Administration was set. As Taipei Metro and Taiwan High Speed Rail started operating, the Taipei City Mall, an extensive underground market, was gradually formed.\r\n\r\nThe whole area related to Taipei Main Station is as large as 46.31 hectares, including the nearby commercial district with businesses and learning institutions, Taipei Transit Station, MRT North Gate Station, Airport MRT Taipei Station, Huashan 1914 Creative Park and other places of the &quot;Taipei Station Specific Area.&quot; It is undoubtedly the biggest hub of transportation in the Taipei&ndash;Keelung metropolitan area.",

      "introduction": "The oldest of its kind in Taiwan, the National Taiwan Museum can be traced back to a showroom for the Bureau of Productive Industries (Shokusankyoku) erected by the colonial-era Taiwan Viceroy&rsquo;s Office in 1899. The showroom&rsquo;s displayed items were relocated to the Lottery Bureau behind the present-day Presidential Office, and gave rise to the 1908 opening of Taiwan Viceroy&rsquo;s Office Museum. During 1913, the Qing-dynasty Tianhou Temple in what is now the 228 Peace Memorial Park was torn down to make way for the &ldquo;Viceroy Kodama Gentaro and Chief Civil Administrator Goto Shinpei Memorial Museum&rdquo;, which was a new project intended to house the Taiwan Viceroy&rsquo;s Office Museum collection. It was rechristened the &ldquo;Museum of Taiwan Province&rdquo; in 1945 and &ldquo;Taiwan Provincial Museum&rdquo; in 1949, before receiving its current title &ldquo;National Taiwan Museum&rdquo; in 1999.\r\n\r\nSitting at the other end of Guanqian Road from Taipei Main Station, the National Taiwan Museum features a Grecian fa&ccedil;ade with towering columns, an acanthus leaves-embellished pediment and a domed hall accentuated by 32 columns, each with an ornate Corinthian capital, in addition to stained-glass skylights through which sunlight filters to cast dazzling patterns on the ground. While sentimentally bearing witness to Taiwan&rsquo;s history, the Museum offers exhibitions as well as irregular events on a scale much unchanged since its founding.",

The overall decoration lacks complexity, yet fineness can be found in its simple, understated beauty. The architectural design of the building was deeply influenced by the classical European style. The first floor of the structure was built using heavy piling of stone materials laid to form an elegant arcade of four columns and three spaces, where the arches are composed of trapezoid Qili&rsquo;an rocks. Patterns pieced together by wood can be found in the arcade ceiling. The second floor and roof trusses are all made of wood, covered with pieces of asbestos tiles on the mansard roof. The outward appearance features steep roof and dormers on the fa&ccedil;ade, as well as stone arcade columns. It is an imitation of a Renaissance style building and is the only remaining detached western-style shop still extant today that was built during the Japanese Colonial Period.",

      "introduction": "The earliest building of the Museum of Medical Humanities, initially belonging to the medical school of Taihoku Imperial University, was completed in 1907 by Kondo Juro under the Japanese colonial rule. The century-old main structure was unveiled later in 1913 and is largely still preserved today, thanks to frequent restoration efforts. Initially used to house classrooms and an administrative center, the main structure grew into a national hub of medical research, a fortress of medical education reform, a site of medical humanities education and, in 2008, a museum. In addition to permanent exhibits such as &ldquo;A New Born&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Peopling of Taiwan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taiwanese People&rsquo;s Struggle against Diseases&rdquo;, the Museum offers special exhibits every six months to explore the impact of medical studies. It also displays exhibit items at medical education institutions nationwide. In the style of the later French Renaissance, the stately museum features graceful curves and carvings in the lobby, on the main wall and columns, with arched designs sumptuously used in the lobby and hallways for extra elegance. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in 1930 and destroyed the Mansard-style, slanted roof with slates, bronze and a little round window on top of it.\r\n\r\nFront entrance\r\nThe west wing was first constructed in 1907\r\nThe semi-outdoor corridor in the south wing, photographed by Jack M. S. Hsu\r\nThe restored rooftop in 1997, photographed by Jack M. S. Hsu\r\nThe indoor hallway of north wing\r\nThe restored lobby",

In fact, the former name of today&rsquo;s Ketagalan Blvd was &quot;East Gate Street,&quot; the way leading to the East Gate.\r\n\r\nToday, the East Gate is a place where protester rallies or parades always pass by due to its location right in front of the Office of the President.

Born in Tainan City in 1921, she learned the basics of dancing from Ishii Baku, the Japanese &ldquo;father of modern dance&rdquo;, before committing herself to introducing modern dance into Taiwan. She was revered as &ldquo; the mother of Taiwanese modern dance&rdquo; because of her 500-odd productions that cover genres ranging from ballet to folk dances of all ethnicities; the productions she helped inspired include: &ldquo;The Song of India&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Love Our Taiwan&rdquo;. The historic structure of Tsai Jui-yueh Dance Research Institute was one of the tens of dormitories for Japanese colonial officials built around 1925 on Zhongshan N. Rd. and downtown Taipei; they were mostly wooden, Japanese-style duplexes. In 1953, Tsai purchased this former residence of a Japanese &ldquo;Haninkan&rdquo; official, with part of the house designated for choreographic rehearsals. She went on to convert it into a dance studio. In 1999, scholars insisted that Tsai&rsquo;s dance studio, once destroyed in a fire and coveted by real estate developers, should be restored as a historic site in homage to Taiwanese modern dance.",
